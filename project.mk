# This file contains information about all of the variables that can
# be set for this workflow

# Files should not have spaces in them; make doesn't deal particularly
# well with spaces.

# If you change an option, don't forget to uncomment (remove the
# leading #) the line that youv'e changed. Commented lines indicate
# the defaults

# Required options

# Number of reads per fragment; 2 is paired-end, 1 is unpaired. This
# actually defaults to 1, but you probably don't really want that.
NREADS=2 

# List of FASTQ files; must be named _1 _2 for paired-end,
# unrestricted for unpaired
FASTQ_FILES=file1_1.fastq.gz file1_2.fastq.gz file2_1.fastq.gz file2_2.fastq.gz

# Everything else below is optional

## The species that this data is
# SPECIES=homo_sapiens
## The species to align it to; usually the same as $(SPECIES)
# ALIGNMENT_SPECIES=$(SPECIES)

## The species name in ensembl (usually the same as $(SPECIES) with
## the first letter capitalized)
# ENSEMBL_SPECIES=Homo_sapiens
## The name of the genome in ensembl (for humans, this is GRCh38)
# ENSEMBL_GENOME=GRCh38

## if you were using mouse, this would be
# SPECIES=mus_musculus
# ENSEMBL_SPECIES=Mus_musculus
# ENSEMBL_GENOME=GRCm38

## if you need to do something more complicated, you can directly
## specify the GTF, FASTA, CDNA_FASTA, and NCRNA_FASTA file names
## instead of building them from species, genome, and release.

### in some cases (more recent mouse genomes) cufflinks cannot handle
### certain features in the GTF file, and you may need to fix the GTF
### file. Use the following rule (for mice) to clean that up. See
### https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/cufflinks/issues/77 for the
### issue which brought this up. (Hopefully fixed in cufflinks
### versions newer than 2.2.1
# CUFFLINKS_GTF=$(REFERENCE_DIR)$(ENSEMBL_SPECIES).$(ENSEMBL_GENOME).$(ENSEMBL_RELEASE)_fixed.gtf
# $(CUFFLINKS_GTF): $(GTF)
# 	grep -v '\tSelenocysteine\t' $^ > $@

## The ensembl release to use (new releases of this workflow will use
## newer revisions, so specify it.
# ENSEMBL_RELEASE=84

## Whether to strip out patches or not; probably only useful for Homo
## Sapiens
# STRIP_PATCHES=1
# STRIP_PATCHES_SCRIPT=./rnaseq_workflow/strip_patches.pl
# STRIP_PATCHES_OPTIONS=--valid-chr='^(?:chr)?[12]?\d|MT|[XY]$$'

# Options for cufflinks; --max-bundle-frags avoids HIDATA errors
# CUFFLINKS_OPTIONS=--max-bundle-frags=400000000

# If you do not wish to trim, uncomment the following
# NOTRIM=1

## To change the trimming options, create a fasta file which contains
## the appropriate primers, and point trimmomatic at it. Something
## like this will work:
# TRIMMOMATIC_OPTIONS=ILLUMINACLIP:./your_fasta_file.fa:2:20:5 MINLEN:10

## If you are using kallisto, and these are single-end reads, you'll
## want something like the following:
# KALLISTO_QUANT_ARGS=--single --bias --bootstrap-samples=200 --fragment-length 21 --sd 5
